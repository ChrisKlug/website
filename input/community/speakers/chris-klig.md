Chris Klug is a developer-badass-as-a-service that either creates or solves problems depending on who you ask. He loves creating and building things. Whether it be a new application, a new kitchen or a new RC helicopter, and you will see him building things all the time. Most of the time, that means writing code and solving problems for clients at a company called Active Solution in Stockholm though. Except for the many days he spends talking about doing things he is passionate about at conferences and usergroups, and the days he goes mountain biking, IPSC shooting or kiteboarding.
For the last 20-ish years, he has been solving problems for customers, and loving it. But if he gets to choose, he'll go to the beach and kitesurf every day!
